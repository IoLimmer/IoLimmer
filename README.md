### Greetings friends, romans, and potential employers. ðŸ˜Ž

They call me Io (they/tehm), I'm a recent grad from the University of Bristol, working as a Junior Software Developer, but in my free time I make silly little video games in Godot.

I also co-wrote a paper on classifying glitches and bugs from the Super Mario series in a more mainstream, cyber-security way. I'll be presenting this at the ICSE games workshop in April in Lisbon. ðŸŒžðŸ¥³

I am proficient in:
- Python
- Bash
- C++
- HTML
- C#
- SQL
- LaTeX

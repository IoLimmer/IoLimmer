### Greetings friends, romans, and employers. ðŸ˜Ž

They call me Io (they/them), I'm a alum of the University of Bristol, working as a Junior Software Developer, but in my free time I make silly little video games in Godot, and I'm off to study Animation in London in September.

I also co-wrote "Super Mario in the Pernicious Kingdoms", a paper on classifying glitches and bugs from the Super Mario series in a more qualitative, mainstream cyber-security way. I had the good fortunate to present this paper at ICSE 2024 in Lisbon in April and you can find it [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3643658.3643917). ðŸŒžðŸ¥³

I am proficient in:
- Python
- Bash
- C++
- HTML
- C#
- SQL
- LaTeX
